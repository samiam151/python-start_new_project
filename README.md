# Python: New Web Project Script
This is a Python script I made to start new projects, after getting tired of 'mkdir'ing and 'touch'ing a host of new files and folders every time I wanted to start something new.

### What It Wants
This script takes two command line arguements: the location the ROOT folder will go, and the name of the project.

For example, if I want a project folder right where I am, I'll say 'python new_project.py . new'.

### What You Get
When you run the script, it creates a root folder in the location you specified. That folder as a -styles folder, a -scripts folder, -data folder
